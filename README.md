# Google Photos Cleaner

Lets say you are using Google Photos.
One day you want to export all the photos that you saved over the years.

You can do that by using this- https://www.google.co.il/search?q=google+photos+export&oq=google+photos+export&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.6519j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
After you download the archives, there some unnecessary files(json) and the google order directories.
